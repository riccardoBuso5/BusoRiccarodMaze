# BusoRiccarodMaze
RaceUp Project

I decided to use, the rule of the right as the algoritm.  
starting from a point "S",  I turn right until I find a wall, marking evry step i do to avoid loops. 
When i get stuck, I go back to the last crossroad that I found before and start again and explore the other direction.
The program stops when I find the "E".
