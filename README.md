# BusoRiccarodMaze
RaceUp Project

I decided to use, the rule of the right as the algoritm.  
starting from a point "S",  I turn right until I find a wall, marking evry step i do to avoid loops. 
When i get stuck, I go back to the last crossroad that I found before and start again and explore the other direction.
The program stops when I find the "E".


from terminal, located in the same folder as the file,
compile with the command " javac filename.java " and then run it with the command "java filename".

following the instructions of the program insert line by line the maze and write "end" once finished.

maze like this  "S...#..E"
